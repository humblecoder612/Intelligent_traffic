# Welcome to Intelligent Traffic

Using image processing and computer vision on traffic signal to do time manipulation and synchronization according to traffic,emergency vehicles and accident to **reduce traffic** and **damage prevention**.


# Steps

Step 1: Download the coco weights and place accordingly 
Step 2: Run the test script according to webcam or video
Step 3 : Run the tmain jupyter file to get the signal status according to lanes and synchronization of it
Step 4 : For accident detection , go to the inference script. (soon upload the weight files)
